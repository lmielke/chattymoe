To loop through files and folders in PowerShell, you can use the Get-ChildItem cmdlet. Here is an example code block:

<code>
Get-ChildItem -Path 'C:\myfolder' -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
    # Perform actions on each file/folder here
    Write-Host 'File/folder name: $_'
}
<\code>

In this example, the Get-ChildItem cmdlet is used to retrieve all files and folders in the 'myfolder' directory and its subdirectories (-Recurse parameter). The output is then piped to the ForEach-Object cmdlet, which allows you to perform actions on each file/folder. In this case, we are simply writing the name of each file/folder to the console using the Write-Host cmdlet.

You can modify the actions performed inside the ForEach-Object loop to suit your specific needs.
